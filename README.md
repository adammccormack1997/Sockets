# Drawing Canvas - Web Sockets and p5.js
This is a shared collaborative drawing canvas with p5.js, node and web sockets.
To draw on the canvas simply push down on the mouse and move.


To get this code up and running on your machine you must have node installed. Then place the Sockets folder on your desktop or anywhere you can access easily.
Open your terminal or command prompt and drag the folder into the terminal which will bring you into your folders directory. Use the command 'node server.js' 
to get your server running and then type localhost:3000 into your web browser. If you open another window with the same url you can see when you draw on one 
it appears in the other window in a different colour.
